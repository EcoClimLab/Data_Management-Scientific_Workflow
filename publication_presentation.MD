# Publication /Presentation
## ForestGEO Ecosystems & Climate Lab @ SCBI

Current projects use one of three methods for manuscript preparation:
- Markdown & GitHub 
- Google Docs 
- Word files managed through Dropbox

## Dropbox organization
- The following are recommended contents & naming conventions for Drobpox folder organization.
  - README file- identifies/ links to accompanying GitHub repository 
  - ‘Manuscript’ – current manuscript version
     - ‘zArchive’ – contains all but the latest version
  - ‘References’ – pdfs of references useful for this project. May also contain presentations, notes, etc.
  - ‘Presentations’ – most recent version(s) of presentations about the project 
     - ‘zArchive’ – contains outdated versions, non-editable copies.

## General practices
- References should *always* be inserted with a reference manager (Zotero, Mendeley, or one that is compatible with both).
