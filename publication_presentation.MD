# Publication /Presentation
## ForestGEO Ecosystems & Climate Lab @ SCBI

- At least for now, preparation of publications/ presentations is managed through Dropbox, which facilitates sharing with all collaborators (not just data analysts on Github).
- It may be preferable to eventually move to Rmarkdown in order to better integrate data analysis and manuscript preparation.

## Organization
- The following are recommended contents & naming conventions for Drobpox folder organization.
  - README file- identifies/ links to accompanying Github repository 
  - ‘Manuscript’ – manuscript version.
     - ‘zArchive’ – contains all but the latest version
  - ‘References’ – pdfs of references useful for this project. May also contain presentations, notes, etc.
  - ‘Presentations’ – presentations about the project 
     - ‘zArchive’ – contains outdated versions, non-editable copies.

## General practices
- References should *always* be inserted with a reference manager (Zotero, Mendeley, or one that is compatible with both).
