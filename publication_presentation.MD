### Workflow
Current projects use one of three methods for manuscript preparation:
- Markdown & GitHub 
- Word files managed through Dropbox (see below)
- Google Docs 

### Scientific writing guidance
- Following the [Nature summary paragraph structure](https://www.nature.com/documents/nature-summary-paragraph.pdf) produces good abstracts.
- [Ten simple rules for structuring papers](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619) 

### General practices
- Use a reference manager (Zotero, Mendeley, or one that is compatible with both). Note that manual changes to reference manager fields are lost when references are updated.


#### Dropbox organization
- The following are recommended contents & naming conventions for Drobpox folder organization.
  - README file- identifies/ links to accompanying GitHub repository 
  - ‘Manuscript’ – current manuscript version
     - ‘zArchive’ – contains all but the latest version
  - ‘References’ – pdfs of references useful for this project. May also contain presentations, notes, etc.
  - ‘Presentations’ – most recent version(s) of presentations about the project 
     - ‘zArchive’ – contains outdated versions, non-editable copies.
